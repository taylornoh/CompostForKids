# About Compost-4-Kids

Awarded Best Technical Project at UCLA QWER Hacks.

Compost4Kids is an free interactive web application that provides an educational game for users to teach where to properly dispose of waste (e.g. recycle, compost).

The game displays a character on a city road with different types of trash appearing that need to be put into the correct waste bin. This allows for users to be better prepared for SB 1383, a compost legislation being implemented in 2024.

This website also features a resource page with information on LA County Composting Site, At-Home Activities for Students, Sustainable Agriculture and Food Events, and LGBTQ+ Supportive Food Banks.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
